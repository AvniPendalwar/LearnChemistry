    <h1 id="h1"><u>Electrons</u></h1>
    <p class="p1">Electrons are one of three main types of particles that make up atoms. Unlike protons and neutrons, which consist
        of smaller, simpler particles, electrons are fundamental particles that do not consist of smaller particles. They are a type
        of fundamental particle called leptons. All leptons have an electric charge of  −1  or  0 . Electrons are extremely small. The
        mass of an electron is only about 1/2000 the mass of a proton or neutron, so electrons contribute virtually nothing to the total
        mass of an atom. Electrons have an electric charge of  −1.
    </p>

    <p class="p1">Electrons are found outside the nucleus. Because opposite electric charges attract one another, negative electrons are attracted
        to the positive nucleus. This force of attraction keeps electrons constantly moving through the otherwise empty space around the nucleus. The
        figure below is a common way to represent the structure of an atom. It shows the electron as a particle orbiting the nucleus, similar to the way
        that planets orbit the sun. However, this is an incorrect perspective, as quantum mechanics demonstrates that electrons are more complicated.
