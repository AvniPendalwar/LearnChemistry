    <p class="p1">The word proton is Greek for "first", and this name was given to the hydrogen nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1920.
        In previous years, Rutherford had discovered that the hydrogen nucleus (known to be the lightest nucleus) could be extracted from
        the nuclei of nitrogen by atomic collisions.[3] Protons were therefore a candidate to be a fundamental particle, and hence a building
        block of nitrogen and all other heavier atomic nuclei.
    </p>

    <p class="p1">A proton is a subatomic particle, symbol p or p+, with a positive electric charge of +1e elementary charge and a mass slightly
        less than that of a neutron. Protons and neutrons, each with masses of approximately one atomic mass unit, are collectively referred to as
        "nucleons" (particles present in atomic nuclei).
    </p>

    <p class="p1">One or more protons are present in the nucleus of every atom; they are a necessary part of the nucleus. The number of protons in the
        nucleus is the defining property of an element, and is referred to as the atomic number (represented by the symbol Z). Since each element has a
        unique number of protons, each element has its own unique atomic number.
