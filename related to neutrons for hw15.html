    <h1 id="h1"><u>Neutrons</u></h1>
    <p class="p1">Atoms of all elements—except for most atoms of hydrogen—have neutrons in their nucleus. Unlike protons and electrons, which are electrically charged, neutrons have no charge—they are electrically neutral.The mass of a
        neutron is slightly greater than the mass of a proton, which is 1 <abbr title="(Atomic mass unit) which is about 1.67×10−27 kilograms.">amu</abbr> A neutron also has about the same diameter as a proton, or  1.7×10−15  meters.
    </p>

    <p class="p1">As you might have already guessed from its name, the neutron is neutral. In other words, it has no charge whatsoever and is therefore neither attracted to nor repelled from other objects. Neutrons are in every atom
        (with one exception), and they are bound together with other neutrons and protons in the atomic nucleus.Since neutrons are neither attracted to nor repelled from objects, they don't really interact with protons or electrons.
